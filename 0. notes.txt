React js is a javascript library for building fast and interactive user interfaces
it was developed at facebook at 2011, and currently it's the most popular javascript library for building user interfaces
the heart of all React applications are the components 
the component is a piece of user interface 
so when we use react we are building independent isolated reusable components and then compose them to build complex user interface
the main component in react is the app component, and its chidren components
so the react app is a tree of components exactly like the angular 2
the component is implemented as a javascript class that has state and render method
the state is the data that we want to display when the component is rendered and the render method is used to describe what the ui should look like
the output of the render is a react element which is a simple plain javascript object that maps to a dom element
react element =======> dom element
it's not a real dom element, it's just a plain javascript object that represents the dom element in memory
so react keeps a lightweight representation of the dom in memory which is called the 'virtual dom'
when we change the stat of a component, we get a new react element, react will then compare this element and its chidren with the previous one
it will figure out what has changed and will update a part of the real dom to keep it in sync with the virtual dom 
this is why the library is called react, because when the state changes React reacts to the state changed and updates the dom
angular is a complete framework but react is a (view)library, it only take care of rendering the view, it's very small api to learn
so when building apps with react we need to use other libraries for things like routing or calling http services and so on
---------------------Installation-----------------
npm i -g create-react-app => you don't have to use a specefic version but this to keep along with the course
we use this package to create a new react app 
there are two vs code extensions make using react easier 
1. Simple React Snippets
2. Prettier - Code formatter
you can turn on the format on save option from file => prefrences => format on save
-------------------Create first app----------------
in the cmd => create-react-app hello-world-react
this will install a development server, webpack, babel (for combiling javascript code)
to run the application => npm run start, this will launch the develpment server on port 3000 and open the browser
the public folder is for the public assets of our application and index.html
it has a div with id root, this is where our react application is going to appear, this is the container of our react application
the src folder contains the components, app component is responsible for rendering the home page that you see on port 3000 home page
in the app component the render method returns a div, this is neither a string nor html, it's called JSX (javascript xml)
we use jsx to describe how the ui will look like
to make the jsx code work, we have to pass it to babel (which is a modern javascript combiler), 
so babel will take this jsx syntax and convert it to plain javascript code that browser can understan 
to see this in action go to babeljs.io/repl website, you can write jsx code and it will convert it to plain javascript code and vice verse
the index.js is the entry component for our app 
---------------------Hello world from scrach---------------
delete every things from src folder and create your first application from scrach
create file index.js and see the code inside it in folder hello-world-react
